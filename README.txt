      be placed face up in the Pile. Player 1 always starts first and
      Player 2 goes after.

      before laying a set or discarding a card to the Pile. To take a card
      from the Deck, click the Deck button. To take a card from the Pile,
      click the Pile button.

  4-  After taking a card, the Player must either discard a card to the Pile
